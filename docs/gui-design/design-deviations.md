# Design deviations and recorded decisions

The design bundle is the contract. Where the bundle is silent, or where its
wording conflicts with the repository, the choice and its reason are recorded
here. Entries name the work package that owns the decision.

## WP0

### Deviations file path

`docs/09-qa-and-definition-of-done.md` says `docs/design-deviations.md`;
`AGENTS.md`, WP0 and WP9 say `docs/gui-design/design-deviations.md`. This file
uses the bundle path. The QA reference is treated as a typo.

### GUI logic tests use a Qt-aware runner

WP1's prompt says to test with the in-tree framework. The in-tree framework in
`tests/framework` is deliberately Qt-free and has no `QCoreApplication`. The
backend has signals and a `QTimer`, and widgets need a `QApplication`, so both
test executables reuse the in-tree `TEST_CASE` and `REQUIRE` macros with a
small Qt-aware runner (`vss_gui_backend_tests`, `vss_gui_theme_tests`). The
whole-window walk stays in `vss_gui --selftest`. No new third-party test
framework is added, so the intent of the rule is met.

### No per-write callback from the engine thread

The design says failures must be visible locally. A per-write completion
callback would have to touch a `QObject` from the endpoint strand and risks a
use-after-free when the backend is destroyed with a write pending. The adapter
therefore returns an immediate error for a missing or closed port, queues the
write, and surfaces a queue-full rejection as the engine's error event through
the coalesced batch. The Send panel can show "queued" and the event; it does
not need a per-write signal.

### Integration branch

Work packages merge into `gui/integration`, not `develop`, until WP9. The
design replaces the shell and leaves placeholders between WP2 and WP8, so
merging each package to trunk would make `develop` unusable for the duration.
This is a delivery decision, not a change to the design.

### Qt version pin for builds

The machine has Qt 6.10.3 under `C:\Qt` and Qt 6.12 under
`C:\Repos\common\qt`. A `QT_ROOT` value with a trailing space makes CMake miss
one and silently select the other; the binary then imports a version tag that
the runtime does not export (`qt_version_tag_6_12` against 6.10). All builds
pin `QT_ROOT` without a trailing space and also pass
`-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`.

WP0 used 6.10.3. WP1 needs the approved `Qt6::Svg` module, which the 6.10.3
installation does not have; the 6.12 installation does. GUI builds therefore
pin 6.12.0 from `C:\Repos\common\qt\6.12.0\msvc2022_64`. This is an
environment decision, not a product dependency change: `Qt6::Svg` is the
dependency the bundle already approved.

## WP1

### Offscreen gallery and the system font

The offscreen platform on Windows has no native font database, and the
project forbids bundling a font. `vss_gui_theme_tests` points
`QT_QPA_FONTDIR` at `C:/Windows/Fonts` so the review PNGs show real text
instead of missing-glyph boxes. This is test-only; the product continues to
use the system UI font through `QFontDatabase`, and the test adds no font to
the repository or the build output.

### SegmentedControl uses QRadioButton

The segmented control is a group of exclusive `QRadioButton`s with the
indicator hidden by QSS. That gives screen readers radio-group semantics and
arrow-key behaviour without inventing an accessible interface. The selected
segment is still an accent fill with `onAccent` text, as the design specifies.

### CopyButton paints itself

A 24 px `QToolButton` inherited the 10 px toolbar padding and clipped the
16 px copy glyph. `CopyButton` is now a custom-painted `QAbstractButton` with
the same accessible name, tooltip, focus ring and 24 px target.
