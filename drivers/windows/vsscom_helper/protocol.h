// What the helper service shares with the studio and with the user-mode driver.
//
// The kernel-mode driver has a control device that makes ports on demand. A
// user-mode driver cannot be a bus, so it has no such device. Its ports are
// software devices, and Windows lets only an administrator or SYSTEM make one.
// The helper is a service that runs as SYSTEM and makes them for ordinary
// users, with the same rules as the control device:
//
//   - a user holds at most VSSCOM_HELPER_MAX_PORTS_PER_USER ports, and all
//     users together at most VSSCOM_HELPER_MAX_PORTS;
//   - the hub end of a port opens only for the user who asked for the port
//     (the driver reads the owner from the device property below);
//   - a port goes when the pipe that asked for it closes, whether the caller
//     closed it or died;
//   - a request to make a port is answered when the port's driver has started,
//     so its COM name and hub interface exist by then.
//
// The caller opens the named pipe, then sends one request and reads one reply
// per exchange. A request and a reply are one message each. Open the pipe with
// SECURITY_SQOS_PRESENT | SECURITY_IDENTIFICATION: the helper needs to know the
// user and nothing more.
//
// The constants are enumerators and constant objects and not macros, because the
// preprocessor policy counts the directives of a header. Include <windows.h> and
// <devpropdef.h> before this file.

// COM numbers
//
// A port gets its COM name from the Ports class installer when Windows builds it:
// the lowest number the COM name database (ComDB) has free. A program that wants
// another number, as Device Manager's Advanced > COM Port Number does, asks the
// helper, which runs as SYSTEM and so may do what Device Manager does:
//
//   1. claim the new number in ComDB (refused if another device holds it, or if
//      \.\COMn already exists);
//   2. write it as PortName in the device's hardware key and update its friendly
//      name;
//   3. restart the device, so that the driver reads the new PortName;
//   4. release the old number in ComDB.
//
// Writing PortName into the device's registry key before the port is built does
// not work: Windows then fails to install the port. The change is therefore made
// on a port that exists, and the port is restarted: no program may have it open and
// the hub end must be closed, or Windows refuses to restart it (ERROR_BUSY). The
// reply comes when the port is running again under the new name.
